# What's in this folder?

Here you'll find a file with all saved scores and two little programs to read and reset them.

Scores are stored in the scores.dat file.

## Read Scores

To read scores you'll need to compile the read_scores.c file. To do so, run:

```
gcc read_scores.c -o read_scores
```

Then execute read_scores to have them displayed in the terminal:

```
./read_scores
```

## Reset Scores

To reset all saved scores you'll need to compile the reset_scores.c file. To do so, run:

```
gcc reset_scores.c -o reset_scores
```

Then execute reset_scores to have them displayed in the terminal:

```
./reset_scores
```

# Additional

An in-game method of resetting the scores is a feature to be added in the future.
